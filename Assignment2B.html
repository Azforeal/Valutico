                        Try being a hunter living with werewolves. I’m the definition of “doesn’t fit in”. I’m not Pack, but I’m not the enemy, either.
                        
                        I struggle to survive among werewolves who are stronger and faster than me, and are competitive enough to break a bone or two for the sake of “fun.”
                        
                        Greyson, their alpha, is the worst of them all.
                        
                        Blatantly relentless and twice as deadly, Greyson rules the Pack and expands its territory even though it’s already the largest in the region. I just wish he’d stop interfering with my life. He’s got enough trouble of his own with his incomplete mate bond, but he’s made it his hobby to tease and test me at every opportunity.

                        William Waters grew up in a house silenced by tragedy, where his parents could hardly bear to look at
                         him, much less love him. So it’s a relief when his skill on the basketball court earns him a scholarship 
                         to college, far away from his childhood home. He soon meets Julia Padavano, a spirited and ambitious 
                         young woman who surprises William with her appreciation of his quiet steadiness. With Julia comes her 
                         family; she is inseparable from her three younger sisters: Sylvie, the dreamer, is happiest with her nose
                          in a book and imagines a future different from the expected path of wife and mother; Cecelia, the family’s 
                          artist; and Emeline, who patiently takes care of all of them. Happily, the Padavanos fold Julia’s 
                        new boyfriend into their loving, chaotic household.</td>
